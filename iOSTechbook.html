                Sears has a great feature that allowed customers to order items and pick them up in store with a limited wait time called Merchandise Pick-Up (MPU). Customers would check-in and then a timer would start that indicated the amount of the that the store needed to have the product to the customer by.

                Redesign an application to fit into the Shop Your Way brand application suite while also adding in additional features like a timer.

              <p class="projectcontent">
                At the same time that we were preparing the application for a re-design, we recognized that this would be a good opportunity to incorporate new features such as a pickup timer, coupon promotion and survey in order to gauge user feedback on the new experience. We developed new user flows but kept the same personas from the initial evolution of the product in order to create new experiences while also maintaining the consistency and integrity of the established flows and experiences.

                I was in charge of incorporating all of the branding, design and patterns from the Shop Your Way application into the MPU application in order to create a consistent experience when we integrated it into the Shop Your Way ecosystem.

                      On top of aligning the brand palette to match the Shop Your Way suite, we were tasked with incorporating additional features such as the timer which required an entirely new set of user stories to be created in parallel while still taking into account current user flows.

                      I realized this "reset" of the applications UI style would allow us to take inventory of everything and allow us to develop a style guide which we could then use to port over other application as the suite expanded.

                      I managed to allocate additional time in order to address the increased effort to put together a style guide which would decrease future project timelines and aligned with the UX designers in order to address iOS and Android seperately which had not been done before.

                <p class="projectcontent">
                  Offering the user an experience that includes both visual changes and functional changes, but also keep certain established patterns is tricky. We needed to allow the user to find out what still worked the same and then discovery the new features as well, all while wrapping the entire application in a new look.

                <p class="projectcontent">
                  At the time of the re-design, I needed to decide on whether it was worth updating the entire style of the design or just updated it enough to fit within the Shop Your Way brand ecosystem. Rather than creating an entirely new style guide with patterns and designs we would need to test, I concluded that bringing over some classic and familiar patterns that were familiar to users across all of our brands was a better decision to start with.
                  <br>
                  <br> When we move the experience into a new application the initial cognitive load would be reduced and hopefully prevent abandonment. It also allowed us to delay a true re-design of all application until they were under one cohesive system resulting in a quick and more consistent workflow for development.

                  Another feature we added was the ability for the user to save the profile of their car and pick-up information in order to help get done
                  as fast as possible. We didn't want to try to push other products or services on customers at this point in the process. We wanted to focus
                  on creating to most streamlined and effective flow and experience as possible.

                <p class="projectcontent">
                  Getting user feedback is always important, and we understood that customers would be short on time and attention after picking up items. Therefore I suggested a 2 step approach to user feedback. initially offer a short 1 question assessment of the overall experience. After that we would ask the customer for a more detailed response at a later time.
                  <br>
                  <br> It was decided that we would ask the user to take a short survey of about 5 questions after each MPU item pick-up consisting of 2 question directed at the aesthetics and colors changes, 2 more about the new features and 1 open ended general area.
                  <br>
                  <br> We also offered a delayed response time asking the user if they would like to take the survey at a later time.
