                Discovery Education offers a product called Techbooks which are digital experience of regular textbooks where students and
                teachers can work on materials in a more engaging and hands on way that's is always up to date. I had the opportunity to take over
                as lead designer in order to implement a few requested features and introduce Social Studies Techbook.

                Find solutions to material that was different then the Math Techbook, update the overall look in certain global areas and refine a glossary
                that would work for Social Studies Techbook. We also wanted to take this opportunity to develop a style guide.

              Working with three developers we were tasked with doing front and back-end development in parallel to design so speed and communication were key.

                My job was to go over and evaluate the all of our Techbook products on desktop and mobile in order to understand how they worked and to identify
                where the two products differed in order to create solutions for the design of Social Studies.

                    <p class="project-section-3col">
                    Because we were so tight on time, rapid prototyping and iteration were extremely important when testing new features and having alternative
                    solutions in case they didn't work. Also, to this point I hadn't ever worked in Xcode directly, so animation timing was something I had
                    to learn to communicate differently than on the web.

                    Since we were working with native iOS we had to some nice built in system functions for movement and interaction which we leaned on so
                    we could have a nice foundation of code to save time. We took the time to address high density screens for the first time as well.

                    Planning was pretty tight considering the school year has a few critical dates in which all work must be done by or else you're
                    released major updates in the middle of a school year. We did the best to meet the requirements document and then address some optimizations
                    and improvement on the overall experience as we identified them while addressing the main issues.

                  I was happy with where we were with the application at the time of launch. I wish we could have done more to the general style, but given
                  the time we had met and exceeded what the requirement were. We just needed to see how effective everything was.

                  We took advantage of the fact that glossary had to go through some hefty backend changes to introduced some nice interactions and motion.
                  Above you can see our new loading screen.

                  Below if a demonstration of what we called "Visual History." What we discovered through some user research is that students' use of the
                  glossary would generally stop after about 4 terms in yet they would often retstart. One of the main reasons we found out to be the cause
                  was the fact that students would have a hard time remembering where they were in their term search.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We addressed this by having a certain number of steps always saved with a visual thumbnail. We also kept track of the states so when a
                  user pressed back thumbnail would just slide over to the "forward" pile in the glossary navigation.
