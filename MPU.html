                Sears has a great feature that allowed customers to order items and pick them up in store with a limited wait time called Merchandise Pick-Up (MPU). Customers would check-in and then a timer would start that indicated the amount of the that the store needed to have the product to the customer by.

              <p class="projectcontent">
                Sears has a great feature that allowed customers to order items and pick them up in stor with a limited wait time called Merchandise Pick-Up (MPU). It had been a stand-alone application and was going to be integrated into the Shop Your Way suite of apps resulting in a UI makeover. Since Sears relies strongly on sales from larger appliances and hardware, this feature was seen as a major strength and therefore this was seen as the time to also integrate special and new key features to be introduced at the same time.

              <p class="projectcontent">
                At the same time that we were preparing the application for a re-design, we recognized that this would be a good opportunity to incorporate new features such as a pickup timer, coupon promotion and survey in order to gauge user feedback on the new experience. We developed new user flows but kept the same personas from the initial evolution of the product in order to create new experiences while also maintaining the consistency and integrity of the established flows and experiences.

                      On top of aligning the brand palette to match the Shop Your Way suite, we were tasked with incorporating additional features such as the timer which required an entirely new set of user stories to be created in parallel while still taking into account current user flows.

                      I realized this "reset" of the applications UI style would allow us to take inventory of everything and allow us to develop a style guide which we could then use to port over other application as the suite expanded.

                      I managed to allocate additional time in order to address the increased effort to put together a style guide which would decrease future project timelines and aligned with the UX designers in order to address iOS and Android seperately which had not been done before.
